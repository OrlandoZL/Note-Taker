# Note-Taker

## Description 

I created a note taking web app that takes notes and saves them. I used JavaScript, node, and express to create this web app. It was super challenging using express to create this and routing everything. I created this so that users are able to take notes and create tasks to later look back at. My motivation was to improve on my express.js skills and knowledge.
I wasn't able to get it to fully function as I ran out of time but hope to fix it as soon as I am able to.
